# web-dev-4-quiz-game
This is an interactive console-based quiz game built using JavaScript. It runs entirely in the browser console, asks multiple questions, gives immediate feedback, and tracks the player's score. This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts such as arrays, objects, loops, functions, string manipulation, and conditionals.
